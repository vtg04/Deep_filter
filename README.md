## Loading Models and Images:

We use dlib to load the facial landmark predictor.
The face_recognition library is used to load the reference image (Elon Musk or Cristiano Ronaldo) and get the face encodings.

## Apply Deepfake Filter Function:

Converts the video frame to RGB.
Detects faces and their encodings in the frame.
Compares the detected faces with the reference face encoding.
If a match is found, swaps the face with the reference face. The actual swapping code is a placeholder; you would typically use image processing functions like cv2.seamlessClone for a more realistic swap.

## Main Loop:

Opens the webcam using OpenCV.
Continuously reads frames, applies the deepfake filter, and displays the output.
Ends when the user presses 'q'.
